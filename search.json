Well early on in my first job I discovered literate programming a method of writing code for analysis and papers that made work reproducible and in realising that there is a different way of working from the traditional and pervasive word processor and spreadsheets and that it was not only more efficient, but also meant that it was easier to work in a reproducible and open manner which engendered a passion for Open Research that persists today.\nNow that I’ve explained very briefly how I came to be interested in Open Research I’m going to tell you a bit about how I accidentally started the Open Scholarship Community Sheffield."
