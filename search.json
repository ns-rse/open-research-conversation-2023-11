Well early on in my first job I discovered literate programming a method of writing code for analysis and papers that made work reproducible and realised that there is a different way of working from the traditional and pervasive word processor and spreadsheets.\nNot only was it more efficient, but it also meant that it was easier to work in a reproducible and open manner which engendered a passion for Open Research that persists today.\nNow that I’ve explained very briefly how I came to be interested in Open Research I’m going to tell you a bit about how I accidentally started the Open Scholarship Community Sheffield."

The Research Software Engineering team and associated groups in the University such as IT Research Services and the Library have a small community, we interact regularly on various aspects of service provision and there is a Slack channel. And about a year ago I was tasked with growing the RSE community to improve engagement and members who interacted across the University."

Well thankfully its a really well structured course!\nThe International Open Science and Scholarship Community was established at University of Utrecht and has grown within the Netherlands with 12 local communities at different Universities throughout the Netherlands.\nThe Incubator Programme aims to help grow the OSC community beyond The Netherlands. The Incubator Programme runs over 14 weeks and takes people through setting up a local OSC Community."

I’d like to say I completed all of these in great detail but in reality because this was something I was fitting in around my work the result is a bit patchy. However, with the brilliant support and encouragement from Jenni Adams and a few others I’ve forged ahead and the Open Scholarship Community Sheffield now exists.\nThe Incubator Programme is structured in such a manner as to guide you in the development of a plan for the community which in essence can serve as a basis for grant applications.\nI’m not going to go into the various areas in detail but will cover why communities are important, the mission and vision, member recruitment and community engagement."

    "text": "Why Communities\n\n\n\nImproving the Research Culture: COS Celebrates 10 Years\n\n\n\n\nBeing somewhat naive about the role communities play it was useful to find out how they fit in to effecting culture change and I really like this graphic which I think explains the role communities play well.\nInfrastructure is at the base of the pyramid of culture and behaviour change, you need tools such as the Open Science Framework which allows researchers to register their studies, share materials, data and output at any point to accelerate communication regardless of publication status.\nBut for this to be effective the user experience needs to be low friction to encourage adoption and many popular services integrate with each other and strive to make their tools accessible.\nFrom the top of the pyramid is policy, which derives from funders and institutions, and defines what you have to do within the system to gain recognition.\nThis in turn defines the incentives that reward participants for participating in the system.\nWhilst individuals can always go about changing their own behaviour, this can be challenging when the culture is to maintain the status quo, not all colleagues are keen to change their working practices. But an effective way of supporting and nurturing individuals who are seeking to change is via a supportive community as seeing others using open research practices normalises the behavioural changes, provides support and demonstrates that open research is possible.\nThus communities normalise behaviour and serve to accelerate the adoption of change, in this case Open Research practices, and importantly can feed up the pyramid to the top to influence and shape policy as practices and guidelines develop and mature over time.\n\n\nNosek (2019) Strategy for Culture Change"

This will encourage collaboration between individuals, groups, institutions and organisations seeking to improve transparency and openness in scientific research.\n\n\nThe Mission sets out in broad terms how we will go about achieving the vision and currently reads as…\nThe Incubator Programme guided me through the different steps in identifying who the stakeholders would be both internally such as the Library, Open Research Working Group, Open Research Advisory Group, Heads of Faculties as well as externally such as the UK Research Network.\nThe aim is to have a broad membership not just from University of Sheffield but also Sheffield Hallam and beyond with regular events for people to attend, learn about and share their experience of Open Research."
