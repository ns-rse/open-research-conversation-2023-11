Well early on in my first job I discovered literate programming a method of writing code for analysis and papers that made work reproducible and in realising that there is a different way of working from the traditional and pervasive word processor and spreadsheets and that it was not only more efficient, but also meant that it was easier to work in a reproducible and open manner which engendered a passion for Open Research that persists today.\nOne of the things I was asked to do about a year ago was look into Now that I’ve explained very briefly how I came to be interested in Open Research I’m going to tell you a bit about how I accidentally started the Open Scholarship Community Sheffield."

The Research Software Engineering team and associated groups in the University such as IT Research Services and the Library have a small community, we interact regularly on various aspects of service provision and there is a Slack channel. About a year ago I was tasked with growing the RSE community to improve engagement and members who interacted across the University."

Well thankfully its a really well structured course!\nThe International Open Science and Scholarship Community was established at University of Utrecht and has grown within the Netherlands with 12 local communities at different Universities throughout the Netherlands.\nThe Incubator Programme aims to help grow the OSC community beyond The Netherlands, and the Incubator Programme runs over 14 weeks programme and takes people through setting up a local OSC Community.\nThis involves setting a Mission and Vision, how to go about Community Engagement and Recruiting Members, engaging with Stakeholders, monitoring activity, progress and sustainability.\nI’m not going to cover all of these areas but will state the mission and vision, member recruitment and community engagement."

But an effective way of supporting and nurturing individuals who are seeking to change is via a supportive community as seeing others using open research practices normalises the behavioural changes, provides support and demonstrates that open research is possible.\nThus communities normalise behaviour and serve to accelerate the adoption of change, in this case Open Research practices, and importantly can feed up the pyramid to the top to influence and shape policy as practices and guidelines develop and mature over time.\n\n\nNosek (2019) Strategy for Culture Change"

This will encourage collaboration between individuals, groups, institutions and organisations seeking to improve transparency and openness in scientific research.\n\n\nThe Mission sets out in broad terms how we will go about achieving the vision and currently reads as…\nThe Incubator Programme guided me through the different steps in identifying who the stakeholders would be both internally such as the Library, Open Research Working Group, Open Research Advisory Group, Heads of Faculties as well as externally such as the UK Research Network.\nThe aim is to have a broad membership not just from University of Sheffield but also Sheffield Hallam and beyond with regular events for people to attend, learn about and share their experience of Open Research."
