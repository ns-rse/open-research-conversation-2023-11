## Background

+ Genetic Epidemiologist 2000-2008
+ Cancer Registry Statistician 2008-2009
+ Medical Statistician (Clinical Trials) 2009-2018
+ Data Scientist 2018-2022
+ Research Software Engineer 2022-Present

::: {.notes}
Good afternoon, my name is Neil Shephard and I'm a Research Software Engineer in the Department of Computer Science at
the University of Sheffield.

I've not always been a Research Software Engineer though, and have had a varied career spending time as a Genetic
Epidemiologist, then working at a Cancer Registry before nine years as a Medical Statistician in Clinical Trials and a
stint as a Data Scientist before ending up here.

What relevance does my career have? Well early on in my first job I discovered literate programming a method of writing
code for analysis and papers that made work reproducible and realised that there is a different way of working from
the traditional and pervasive word processor and spreadsheets.

Not only was it more efficient, but it also meant that it was easier to work in a reproducible and open manner which
engendered a passion for Open Research that persists today.


Now that I've explained very briefly how I came to be interested in Open Research I'm going to tell you a bit about how
I accidentally started the Open Scholarship Community Sheffield.

So I've had a long standing interest in open and reproducible research and have taken this extrapolated path to become a
Research Software Engineer. The Research Software Engineering team and associated groups in the University such as IT
Research Services and the Library have a small community, we interact regularly on various aspects of service provision
and there is a Slack channel. And about a year ago I was tasked with growing the RSE community to improve engagement and
members who interacted across the University.

## INOSC Incubator Programme

::: {.notes}
I was browsing through media feeds as I do and I came across the OSC Incubator Programme which was running in early
March 2022 and was advertised as a way of growing your community and I thought this would be a useful way of finding out
some ways to help grow the RSE community at The University of Sheffield.

I can be a bit slow at times and didn't think too much about the key word in the title "Incubator" but signed up.

In the very first session the penny dropped and I realised that I would be establishing a Open Science Community,
which is where the "accidental" part of this short presentation comes from.

So what did I let myself in for? Well thankfully its a really well structured course!

The International Open Science and Scholarship Community was established at University of Utrecht and has grown within
the Netherlands with 12 local communities at different Universities throughout the Netherlands.

The Incubator Programme aims to help grow the OSC community beyond The Netherlands. The Incubator Programme runs
over 14 weeks and takes people through setting up a local OSC Community.

::: {.notes}
This involves setting a Mission and Vision, how to go about Community Engagement and Recruiting Members, engaging with
Stakeholders, monitoring activity, progress and sustainability.

The OSC Incubator Programme spent a session on each, typically three hours once a fortnight on each of these topics with
interactive sessions and break-out groups as well as homework to go off and develop each area and come up with detailed
plans for each. I'd like to say I completed all of these in great detail but in reality because this was something I was
fitting in around my work the result is a bit patchy.  However, with the brilliant support and encouragement from Jenni
Adams and a few others I've forged ahead and the Open Scholarship Community Sheffield now exists.

The Incubator Programme is structured in such a manner as to guide you in the development of a plan for
the community which in essence can serve as a basis for grant applications.

I'm not going to go into the various areas in detail but will cover why communities are important, the mission and
vision, member recruitment and community engagement.

## Why Communities

![[Improving the Research Culture: COS Celebrates 10 Years](https://www.cos.io/blog/cos-celebrates-10-years)](img/COS_Culture_and_Behavior_Change_model2.png){width=75%}

:::{.notes}
Being somewhat naive about the role communities play it was useful to find out how they fit in to effecting culture
change and I really like this graphic which I think explains the role communities play well.

Infrastructure is at the base of the pyramid of culture and behaviour change, you need tools such as the
Open Science Framework which allows researchers to register their studies, share materials, data and output at any point
to accelerate communication regardless of publication status.

But for this to be effective the user experience needs to be low friction to encourage adoption and many
popular services integrate with each other and strive to make their tools accessible.

From the top of the pyramid is policy, which derives from funders and institutions, and defines what you have to do
within the system to gain recognition.

This in turn defines the incentives that reward participants for participating in the system.

Whilst individuals can always go about changing their own behaviour, this can be challenging when the culture is
to maintain the status quo, not all colleagues are keen to change their working practices. But an effective way of
supporting and nurturing individuals who are seeking to change is via a supportive community as seeing others
using open research practices normalises the behavioural changes, provides support and demonstrates that open research is
possible.

Thus communities normalise behaviour and serve to accelerate the adoption of change, in this case Open Research
practices, and importantly can feed up the pyramid to the top to influence and shape policy as practices and guidelines
develop and mature over time.

## Vision

> To be an inclusive, supportive, and active community for researchers to interact, share knowledge and encourage good
> working practices such that the values, transparency and culture of Open Scholarship becomes the norm.

:::{.notes}
The Vision and Mission were curated but I don't currently have these up on the OSC Sheffield website but should probably
get them on the landing page, but its a WordPress site that I haven't completely sussed out how to have a front page
that isn't the most recent blog post.

These aren't necessarily static and can evolve over time but currently the vision is...
:::

## Mission

> We aim to develop and share knowledge and good Open Scholarship practices that foster, enable, encourage and support
> Open Scholarship to be undertaken by anyone at the University of Sheffield wishing to do so.
>
> We encourage community interactions where those with experience meet with those wishing to learn to share, support,
> mentor and encourage good Open Scholarship practices. This will encourage collaboration between individuals, groups,
> institutions and organisations seeking to improve transparency and openness in scientific research.

:::{.notes}
The Mission sets out in broad terms how we will go about achieving the vision and currently reads as...

The Incubator Programme guided me through the different steps in identifying who the stakeholders would be both
internally such as the Library, Open Research Working Group, Open Research Advisory Group, Heads of Faculties as well as
 externally such as the UK Research Network.

The aim is to have a broad membership not just from University of Sheffield but also Sheffield Hallam and beyond with
regular events for people to attend, learn about and share their experience of Open Research.

I've been quite fortunate in getting things going because the University of Sheffield already has structures in place
and many active groups and individuals.

At the top of the pyramid is the Open Research Advisory Group who incentivise and set out how the national policies are
to be implemented. At the bottom under pinning activities are IT Infrastructure and Library services.

Already bridging the middle of the pyramid of behaviour change is Jenni Adams and the Open Research Working Group as
well as many other support staff who are actively engaged in undertaking and promoting Open Research here at the
University and Jenni has been very supportive getting OSC Sheffield up and running and already organises a number of
events.

Various events are already organised that help bring people together to talk about and share ideas around Open Research
practices.

There are the Open Research Conversations, the RSE team have run regular Lunchbyte sessions which cover technical
aspects of conducting research using programming tools and making software FAIR.

Earlier this year saw the return of the successful Sheffield OpenFest which showcased and championed Open Research
activities and the summer saw a series Faculty of Seminars on making data FAIR, Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and
Reusable.

This semester there has seen the first in a series of seminars on How to Share Survey Data led by Ric Campbell and the
first in the series was __How to Share Survey Data_.

With the support of my colleague Grace Accad from IT Services we have re-launched the Sheffield R User group and had two
meetings, one in October and one in November. These are events where people present their work with using the
[R](https://www.r-project.org/) statistical programming language.

With Jim Uttley and Zuzanna Zagrodzka's who ran it previously we are also re-launching the
[ReproducibiliTea](https://reproducibilitea.org/) Journal Club which aims to discuss diverse issues, papers and ideas
about improving science, reproducibility and the Open Science movement and the first of those is scheduled for next week
following the next Open Research Conversation. We'll be meeting in the Diamond next week to discuss a paper on
reproducibility in the psychological sciences and if you follow the links you can find out more about paper that will be
presented and how to attend either in person or online.
